# Data-Science-Capstone

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks and Python code I used to complete the applied data science capstone project.  This is the final project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Program.  

The powerpoint file contains the project presentation where I present the methodology and results of my work.  The principle methods I used in this project were:
- Data Collection using a REST API and by web scraping
- Data wrangling 
- Exploratory data analysis using visualization (Seaborn and Matplotlib)
- Exploratory data analysis using SQL
- Interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash
- Predictive analysis using classification models
    - Logistical Regression
    - Support Vector Machine
    - Decision Tree
    - K-Nearest Neighbors

I hope the work in this project helps to display the knowledge that I have gained from the IBM Data Science certificate program.  Thank you so much for taking the time to explore my work!

Thank you to Coursera for providing this program and to IBM for developing and curating all of the resourses that were available to me.
